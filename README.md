# Varian Developer
Migration of the Varian developer codeplex resources

## Project Description

This open source community project supports Varian collaborators and customers in their work with Varian Medical Systems public APIs.

## Target Audience

* Varian Medical Systems customers who have API licenses (Eclipse Scripting, Eclipse Algorithm, DICOM DB Daemon), or a TrueBeam Developer Mode license.
* Collaborators who have a research agreement with Varian.

## Goals

This project is designed to :

* Help get those people interested in coding against Varian APIs started.
* Promote and enable moderated community-based support for API developers.
* Allow our collaborators and community developers to share their work with others.
* Allow Varian and community developers to share tips and tricks
